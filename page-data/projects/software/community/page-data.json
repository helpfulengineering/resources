Slack+GSuite is great but it has its limitations.</p>\n<p>In parallel, the knowledge and resources shared by Slack will be lost on the history of the chat. We would need to persist it and ease the access over time.</p>\n<p>On a third level, in order to get a bigger support from potential sponsors/media it would be effective to have a public platform where our progress can be followed.</p>\n<p>At last, we have people offering to start coding right away while the real Hw projects get ready.</p>\n<h3>👨‍🔬Hypothesis</h3>\n<p>We need a community platform that would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow volunteers to join, list their skills, time zone and availability.</li>\n<li>Allow volunteers create project proposals, discover existing ones and rate them.</li>\n<li>Allow managers to reach volunteers, assign them tasks and organize teams around. From that point the work can start and be managed in a different tool such as jira or trello.</li>\n<li>Let the managers organize themselves and volunteers based on time zone and availability.\nStore and categorize all the shared knowledge/resources out from a chat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Implementation Status</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Platform delivered over a low-code tool named <a href=\"https://www.outsystems.com/\">Outsystems</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Current Feature List:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User management with their skill set.</li>\n<li>Project management with categories.</li>\n<li>User search based on skills</li>\n<li>Project search based on skills</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻Implementation Suggestion</h2>\n<h3>V1</h3>\n<p>Community website with the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CRUD of users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add location/timezone and skill set.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CRUD of projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project categories.</li>\n<li>CRUD of rating and commenting on projects.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Newsflow where you can follow updates.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moderator dashboard where you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create teams of users and assign them to projects.</li>\n<li>Organize shifts.</li>\n<li>Check who is on for <code>what</code> at any given time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>A single source of truth for project management and team organizations.</p>\n<h3>What it is not</h3>\n<p>Not a substitute of Slack, jira, or trello.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>(Example taken from a banking one built a while ago)</p>\n<p><img src=\"../assets/community1.png\">\n<img src=\"../assets/community2.png\"></p>\n<p>V2 (..repeat the process)\nAdd further functionality when needed.
