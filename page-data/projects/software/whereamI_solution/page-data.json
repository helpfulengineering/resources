The user needs to have a data plan\nor wifi connection. </p>\n<h2>💻Implementation Suggestion</h2>\n<p>Mobile App:\nRact Native or PWA . </p>\n<p>Backend Server:\nMongoDb or another DB with lat/long query capabilities\nNodejs + TypeScript + Graphql + Nestjs?</p>\n<p>Front End:\nVue or React Or Angular 8</p>\n<h3>V1</h3>\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<h3>What it is not</h3>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<h3>Data/Experiments</h3>\n<h2>💪 Impact of Potential Solution</h2>\n<p>Huge</p>\n<h2>🙌 Criteria for Success</h2>\n<p>Number of users using the app and sharing their current location.\nNumber of users using the information to avoid areas with people</p>\n<h2>😅 Known Issues</h2>\n<p>WARNING -> It could have issues related to crime as one can track everyone's location...\nWe could only provide the last 30m location and in case of infection we could share the data\nwith Hospitals/Gov/ETC</p>\n<p>Prob radius needs to be wider 2km or more and center of radius random.
