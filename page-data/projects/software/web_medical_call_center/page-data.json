With the results of these tests a level of infection is computed and users are queued to talk with healthcare professionals via web chat or video. This way high probability cases can be addressed first. </p>\n<h3>🤔 Assumptions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The existence of a <strong>reliable</strong> form or method that can provide a level of infection. </li>\n<li>Healthcare professionals available to talk with “callers” </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>💻Implementation Suggestion</h2>\n<h3>V1</h3>\n<p>Platform with two main actors: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Patients\nPhone number based authentication to ensure that one person doesn’t make multiple diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Can perform a self-diagnosis test by: a) filling a form b) undergoing some kind of test such as blood oxygen saturation (to be discussed). Then, they are queued to talk with a healthcare professional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Healthcare professionals\nShould be authenticated.\n\nTasks:\n- Engage in a chat (text, audio or video) with the patients that took the test.\n- If necessary, request a given patient to perform the test again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Server: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store results of self-diagnosis tests to keep track of patients diagnosis and current virus situation. </li>\n<li>Compute level of infection and queue patients based on this value. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>(what are we testing and the hypothesis we’re testing)</p>\n<h3>What it is not</h3>\n<p>Not a self-diagnosis tool.
