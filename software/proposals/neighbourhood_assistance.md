## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why
**PIN** - Persons in Need (elderly, immunocompromised, quarantined)
**CAV** - Community Area volunteer
**OA** - Official Authority

### 💥 Problem
In a contention/quarantine mode, people tend to stay alone with their families at home. Those with special needs or with weak or no social support are more at risk. Common day to day activities during contention/quarantine days are of high risk for these people in need.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis
Have those in need of help/resources request it through their preferred means (app, SMS, website, etc.) and relay those to, either existing, trusted volunteer organizations, or local organizations led by neighbors (Community Area Volunteer). The organization will then lead the volunteer operation for shopping/pickup/delivery.

### 🤔 Assumptions

 - People will use a system that is built on trust and is accessible
 - People are creating volunteer groups within their communities that the locals trust
 - Small Organizations are finding problems in scaling up and measuring their impact 
## 💻Implementation Suggestion
### V1
Mobile app that allows Persons In Need to open requests in their behalf or on others'. Connecting them to small organizations by proximity and availability, and allowing those organizations to respond acordingly while measuring whether the requests were fulfilled or not.

### What it is
A better way for established organizations and spontaneous organizations to coordinate volunteering efforts.

### What it is not
This is not another volunteer organization aimed to fulfill aid requests.

### Data/Experiments
What are the issues smaller but established organisations are having as they scale? We contacted some and they find difficulty in keeping up with the storage of data (mostly Google Sheets) and the coordination of the volunteers.

### V2
Introduce support for bigger organizations, facilitating registering of volunteers in our platform. Better severity assessment features so the organizations prioritize their effort better.

## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution

 - Better support for isolated people due to quarantine, improving their
   lives and the ones around them.
 - Better resource management for organizations;

## 🙌 Criteria for Success

 - Adoption rate/New users per day
 - Request fulfillment rate
 - Positive feedback from organizations
 - Effective and healthy interaction between all actors

## 😅 Known Issues

 - Background check on volunteers
 - Adoption of larger organizations
 - Some interactions between actors will go wrong inevitably
