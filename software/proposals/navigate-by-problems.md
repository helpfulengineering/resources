## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

**It's extremely difficult to understand what problems are faced, what solutions have already been proposed to solve them, and where there's room for further innovation efforts.**

Then, once you've found a project, there's extra effort required just to understand if/how you can contribute based on a few key attributes.

This creates friction for eager helpers to get onboard with projects that are appropriate matched to their skillset/interests/network. That's costly wasted potential given the huge volume of support in the HE community so far and the urgent need for deployed solutions.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

- Navigating projects by the problem that they’re solving instead of the solution they’re applying is more intuitive when trying to assess where the gaps are in the overall approach.
- As an engineer, matching current skillset with project tech stacks is a crucial filter when looking for where there’s space to help.
- Other skill profiles will need/prefer to filter by location or teamsize in order to find where they can apply themselves usefully. For example, with specific legal knowledge or physical resources, or languages, or networks to leverage.
- Drilling even further, filtering by level of experience / commitment required to contribute would be a key enabler for eager helpers that have less time available to dedicate around dayjobs and other responsibilities.


### 🤔 Assumptions

## 💻Implementation Suggestion
Move the current project data behind an api that we can design and build a better interface for discovery and exploration of initiatives.

For example a more engaging visual layout like a snapshot of this [Mural ideation board](https://app.mural.co/t/covid19support6978/m/covid19support6978/1584393427704/b605ace2a88659e4cced1c9560c2a8c1cdadf8dc) below, but enhanced with links to actual projects and easily filterable (thanks to @Mike Gyi for sharing).

### V1
Migrate and continue to aggregate project metadata to [Airtable](https://airtable.com/). They're [supporting humanitarian efforts](https://blog.airtable.com/airtables-support-for-covid-19-response-efforts/) with free pro features, and their product offering fits this usecase pretty well.

That way there's still the familiar ease of a spreadsheet UI format like Google Docs to update information, but there's also an API exposed to build some static site pages allowing better expression and exploration of the problem-solution mapping in progress.

### What it is
A slight change of platform to capture all the current crowdsourced efforts and information under a more accessible umbrella.

### What it is **not**

- taking over all project administration
- a solo project! (please reach out and get involved if this moves you @jonnyparris)

### Design
Something like the snapshot above, but better 🤷🏾‍♂️ - design help much appreciated!

### Data/Experiments
n/a

## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution
Huge acceleration of project engagement, especially over the coming weekend - more projects, with more rounded teams, ideally releasing and delivering value faster.

## 🙌 Criteria for Success
(Main KPIs, metrics to evaluate and results to achieve)

- New project proposals begin to fill up on the new platform organically
- The design is so accessible that it gets shared in wider media, not just the Slack community

## 😅 Known Issues
I am but one pair of hands so far!

## ✅ "I've read this" section
