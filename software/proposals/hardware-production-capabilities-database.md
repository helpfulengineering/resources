## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

Many volunteers are offering 3D printing, CNC and other production services but currently we have no overview.
When designs need te be rolled out we need people know what local production capability there is and how to contact them.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

A structured database (or online excel) alongside a map will help with production roll out.

### 🤔 Assumptions

Assumption 1, assuming we need a more structured way of cataloging production volunteers.

Assumption 2, I think this problem is not yet tackled by other proposals.
I'm sensing some overlap with [web_app_resource_management](https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/proposals/web_app_resource_management.md)
and the several overarching project management proposals.

## 💻Implementation Suggestion

### V1

### What it is
Basic database (online spreadsheet) where individuals can volunteer their production capabilities.

Registering:
* Type (CNC, 3D printing, other)
* Location
* Contact information (slack handle?)

### What it is not
It is not a go all place to offer volunteer help.
It would just shown volunteers able to help with producing proven design and prototypes.

V1 will be about storing data, no visualization yet.

### Design
Online spreadsheet to get the idea: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIdCv0yNLarHZKBnzuomJb5OAwem8KpMSLcDqbwfvYo/edit?usp=sharing

### Data/Experiments
Need access to form submission about production capabilities.

### V2
Visualization of available production capabilities.
Probably an interactive map.

## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution

* Allow for faster transition into production by having this part of the logistics in place.
* Reduce slack and other channel clutter.


## 🙌 Criteria for Success
1. Database contains comprehensive yet structured view of volunteer production capabilities.
1. All new production capabilities are registered here.
1. Existing Google form data is imported. 

## 😅 Known Issues

Data is already coming in through other means.
Notably the volunteer Google form.
1. We need to integrate/replace that process.
1. Import data (probably manual work) from existing submissions. 
1. Overlapping idea with now already existing spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t3UVO1YkxWyhBxVFT-uMTBt4iTljawjjs_iTuS8W6yE/edit#gid=0
