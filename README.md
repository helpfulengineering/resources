# Helpful Engineering

## Software proposals

The scope of this document is to aggregate all the software project proposals under [Helpful Engineering, Project Open air](https://www.projectopenair.org/). If you didn't join yet you can find our Slack group [here](https://join.slack.com/t/helpfulengineering/shared_invite/zt-csc50xh2-fUHR8BDGIqPDVyadU73roA).

A good starting point is our [Start document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cM87eJdXhP_8e9gJJZ_SnZXdo_huWsBmMzcqYWbhEOg/edit#)

In order to submit a new idea, please refer to the following [template.](https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/template.md)

Once your proposal is ready, you can both share it in the `#software-project-proposal` room. Clone this repo and create a new branch with the format PROJECT-[your-project-name] and submit a PR to this repo.  Reach out to our slack channel #software for any questions.

Other software channels:
* `#medical-software` Main landing channel with general discussion.
* `#software`: Discussions on ongoing projects: ask for help, beta testers, bugs etc
* `#meta-proposals-discussion`: Discussions on hardware and software application (web), and software (data science) proposals.
